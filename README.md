Hello, my name is Julian Leonel Rocco. I have knowledge of HTML and CSS, which I apply to the development of personal websites and some future projects, always with a creative and functional approach.
Although I have skills in web development, my true academic background is focused on Economics, Business Administration, and International Trade, a field I am currently studying at the university level.
My main goal is to use web development as a tool to visually and interactively showcase and communicate the knowledge I acquire in the economic and commercial fields.
**JulianRocco/JulianRocco** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
